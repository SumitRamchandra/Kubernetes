How to remember if it is a Public Certificate or a private key.

public Certificates:
- server.crt
- server.pem
- client.crt
- client.pem

Private Key:
- server.key
- server-key.pem
- client.key
- client-key.pem

If you see the term "key" in the name or in extension, it means it is an private key. Rest is public certificates.
