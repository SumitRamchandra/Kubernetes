Kubernetes is an open source system for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications, particularly cloud native applications written using microservices. 

Kubernetes (K8s) allows administrators to cluster containers together to make them easier to manage.

We need Kubernetes to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of complex containerized applications, providing self-healing, load balancing, and rolling updates for high availability and reliability, saving development time, optimizing resources, and enabling portability across different cloud/on-prem environments, especially for microservices and large-scale systems. 

Key Reasons to Use Kubernetes:

1. Automation: Automates tasks like scheduling containers, managing deployments, rolling updates, and self-healing (restarting failed containers).
2. Scalability & Reliability: Automatically scales applications up or down based on traffic, ensuring high availability and resilience against node failures.
3. Efficiency: Optimizes hardware usage, potentially reducing costs, and allows teams to focus on building features, not managing infrastructure.
4. Portability: Runs consistently across public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises, reducing vendor lock-in.
5. Microservices & Modern Apps: Provides a robust foundation for complex, cloud-native applications and microservices architectures.
6. Service Management: Offers built-in service discovery and load balancing to distribute traffic evenly across containers.
7. DevOps Efficiency: Streamlines development and operations with features like declarative configurations, rollbacks, and standardized management. 

When You Might Need It (and When You Might Not)

- You likely need it if: You have microservices, dynamic workloads, need high availability (minimal downtime), run complex apps at scale, or want to avoid cloud lock-in.
- You might not need it if: You have a simple, small application, as Kubernetes adds complexity and overhead.
